My codes for the problems I solved. The problems are mainly from LightOJ, UVA, Codeforces, SPOJ etc. <br/>

N.B: All these codes were bulk uploaded, which is also many days later after actually writing them. So, I couldn't test them before uploading. As a result, there are few codes which are incomplete or gives a wrong solution. Please test the codes at first by submitting them in OJ before using them.
